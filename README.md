<h2><a href=https://jakeespinosa.github.io/landingPage>Check Out The Live Web Page!</a></h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
As part of The Odin Project's curriculum, I created an entire web page from a provided design. I wrote<br>
out the HTML content, organized it to facilitate styling, then styled it using CSS and flexbox. This<br>
project allowed me to hone my HTML and CSS skills in a self-guided fashion. I used git to manage<br>
the versioning and Chrome DevTools to debug the CSS.I took a few creative liberties (as permitted by<br>
the curriculum) to modify the web page to better fit my eye.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- HTML<br>
- CSS (including flexbox)<br>
